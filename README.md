# conFusion_restaurant_app (on a very early stage, will soon try to learn and update here).
A very simple app for beginners(like me) to learn and understand how to use bootstrap to make website attractive and responsive to different devices and much more.


# Installations
1) npm
 - Install Node Package Manager (especially because I've used lite server).
 - Link (to checkout the complete steps and procedure): https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
 
2) lite server
 - A lightweight node server serving web apps.
 - Link (to checkout the complete steps and procedure): https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server
 - Pro: Easy to use.
 - Cons: For development only.
 
3) Further checkout the dependencies from package.json file. 


# Make few changes in package.json file  
"scripts": {
    "start": "npm run lite",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "lite": "lite-server"
  }
 
# Running web app on localhost
 - Set the current directory
 - use command: npm run lite 
 
# Points to Consider
 - Can use cdn links or download them using npm for bootstrap, font-awesome, etc.
 - Almost everybody knows but use ctrl+shift+I to open console to see if any of the bootstrap files or other dependencies not working properly.
 - Do visit documentation for the dependencies to learn more.
 - Bootstrap doc: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/.
